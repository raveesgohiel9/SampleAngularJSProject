This project is just a sample Angular JS project with out a UI. I created this first demo as a part of my practice. 
The UI is not good at all. It is just very basic
However, the project us very basic. If someone is trying to learn Angular and doesn't know where to begin. I recommend taking 
a look at this project. 
I would say that there are a few main files/modules that you must be looking at in this project. 
->src/app/app.component.ts
->src/app/app.module.ts
->src/app/components/about
->src/app/components/user
->src/app/components/services


You can run this project on your mac. 
Step1 - 
Install nodejs on your computer. Go to https://nodejs.org/en/

Step2 - Install  angular 4 in your compauter in a directory or workspace where you will create your angular projects. 
e.g.  cd WorkDrive/Workspace
Then use the command to install angular 4 in that directory using the following command
npm install -g @angular/cli

Step3 - You can create a new project using ng new MyApp where MyApp is the name of the project. However, in this case we 
already have an existing project. So you can simply copy and paste the project in the Workspace folder.

Step 4 - cd into MyApp project using the command
cd MyApp

Step 5  - Start the local server to open the project using the commanf
ng serve

Once you run this command and press enter, you will see Webpack compiled successfully. 

Then you can go to your web browser(I use chrome) and open the project by using the following url
localhost:4200
